## Example Game

Enter moves using algebraic notation:  `[from] [to]`

For examples:
```
> e2 e4        # Move pawn from e2 to e4
> e7 e8q       # Move pawn from e7 to e8 and promote to queen
> e1 g1        # Kingside castling (if conditions are met)
```
## Promotion Pieces

When promoting a pawn, add the piece code at the end: 
- `q` = Queen
- `r` = Rook
- `b` = Bishop
- `n` = Knight

## Advanced Features

### Custom Game Setup

```python
from chess import ChessCore

# Create a new game
game = ChessCore()

# Start with black pieces
game.play(side="black")

# Enable automatic queen promotion
game.play(auto_promotion="queen")

# Disable auto-promotion (manual choice)
game.play(auto_promotion=False)
```

### Programmatic Play

```python
from chess import ChessCore

# Create a new game
game = ChessCore()
game.launch_partie(side="white")

# Play a sequence of moves
moves = ["e2 e4", "e7 e5", "g1 f3", "b8 c6"]
for move in moves:
    result = game.play_move(move)
    if result == 'checkmate':
        print("Game Over!")
        break
```

### Custom Board Positions

You can load any chess position using the `load_board()` method.

```python
from chess import ChessCore, Board

game = ChessCore()

# Define piece constants or import from constants.py
EMPTY = 0
PAWN = 1
KNIGHT = 3
BISHOP = 4
ROOK = 5
KING = 7
QUEEN = 9

# Create a custom position
# Example: King and Pawn endgame
custom_board = [
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, KING, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, PAWN, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, -PAWN, EMPTY, EMPTY],
    [EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, -KING, EMPTY]
]

# Load the custom position
game.load_board(custom_board)

# Start playing from this position
game.launch_partie(side="white")
```

#### Piece Encoding

When creating custom boards, use these values: 

| Piece | White | Black |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Empty | 0 | 0 |
| Pawn | 1 | -1 |
| Knight | 3 | -3 |
| Bishop | 4 | -4 |
| Rook | 5 | -5 |
| King | 7 | -7 |
| Queen | 9 | -9 |
